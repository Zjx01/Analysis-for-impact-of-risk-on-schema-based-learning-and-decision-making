Schema is a knowledge organization critical for cognition and decision making via prior knowledge retrieval and new situation interpretation. Such schema-based learning is essential for education, however, the modulatory role of risk on decision making during schema-based learning is rarely known. To evaluate this, painting schema model is adopted (designed by Gedi Lusky). Participants are divided into high risk or low risk group and undergo painting exploration and decision session repetitively to select 4 schemas from the same author in each decision session to earn money. The result proves the existence of learning and validates the effectiveness of the schema-based learning model.
